Gepard is software for analysis of three-dimensional distribution of quarks and gluons in hadrons,
encoded in terms of so-called Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD).

This web site has manifold purpose:

   * Interface to various representations of results: numerical and graphical
   * Interface to datasets used in analyses: numerical and graphical
   * Documentation of the software

The software itself is available from download at GitHub (well, not yet, it will be
after documentation is written)
