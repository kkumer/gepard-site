Tool for studying the 3D quark and gluon distributions in the nucleon
=====================================================================


Gepard is software for analysis of three-dimensional distribution of quarks and gluons in hadrons,
encoded in terms of the so-called Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs).

This web site has manifold purpose:

   * Documentation of the software
   * Examples of the use of software
   * Interface to various representations of results: numerical and graphical
   * Interface to datasets used in analyses: numerical and graphical
